# SpreeAdminBar

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/stefansenk/spree_admin_bar.svg) ](https://travis-ci.org/stefansenk/spree_admin_bar)

Adds an admin bar to a [Spree](http://github.com/spree/spree) E-Commerce platform shop front-end, allowing an admin user to quickly navigate to the relevant sections within the site admin pages.

The admin bar gets displayed at the top of each page to users logged in as an admin. It works with following the entities:
* Products
* Taxons/Taxonomies
* Pages  ([Spree Static Content](https://github.com/spree-contrib/spree_static_content)) - not implemented yet in version 3.0.0
* Related Products  ([Spree Related Products](https://github.com/spree-contrib/spree_related_products)) - not implemented yet in version 3.0.0

### Background

We found this simple admin bar really speeds up working on a Spree site. When browsing the site front end, we often found we wanted to jump to the relevant section in the admin to make a small change. This admin bar greatly speeds up the time it takes to navigate to the relevant section in the admin.


## Installation

1. Add this extension to your Gemfile with this line:
  ```ruby
  gem 'spree_admin_bar', github: 'stefansenk/spree_admin_bar'
  ```

2. Install the gem using Bundler:
  ```ruby
  bundle install
  ```

3. Copy & run migrations
  ```ruby
  bundle exec rails g spree_admin_bar:install
  ```

Or just add `*= require spree/frontend/spree_admin_bar`

to your css file, e.g. `/vendor/assets/stylesheets/spree/frontend/all.css`


4. Restart your server

  If your server was running, restart it so that it can find the assets properly.

## Testing

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake
```

When testing your applications integration with this extension you may use it's factories.
Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:

```ruby
require 'spree_admin_bar/factories'
```
